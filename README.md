# Pin My YouTube video *Electron*

** Dased on [Electron quick start boilerplate](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start) **

This is my very first Electron project, it was inspired by a previous application I made using Autoplay Media Studio (by drag and drop, with no experience in programming), and I called it [YouTube tuto helper](http://fcmam5-aio.blogspot.com/2014/04/youtube-tuto-helper-beta.html).

## The idea
A YouTube video player to pin on top of your windows, it could be helpful when trying to follow step-by-step tutorial, or when watching a YouTube live streaming while working or chatting.

## Todo
- [ ] Add pin-to-top option [ON/OFF]
- [ ] Add awesome features
